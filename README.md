# Keras Model for Detecting Malware Binaries

## License:
**This code is public domain.  Use at your own risk.  No warranties.**

## Inputs
87072 malware binaries from virussign.com

4047 binaries scraped from Windows and Linux

## 20k model

Trained on the 1st 20kb of each malware file.

Training consisted of 3 epochs.

accuracy: 0.9991
 
loss: 0.0029

val_accuracy: 0.9986

val_loss: 0.0043

## 40k model
Trained on the 1st 40kb of each malware file.


## Multi-model for fewer false positives

`classify.py` shows an example of using both the 20k model and the 40k model to cancel out
each other's false positives and negatives.
